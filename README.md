# expense_app

Application developed in Flutter which aims to keep track of personal expenses.
The application provides a form to enter purchase data and displays the transactions in a list with the ability to see in a graph the amount of money spent in the various days of the week.
This is my first application and it is only for try so the data will not be saved if you will close the application.
